Views
1. Home Page
1. Contribution Profile Page - Each GitHub username with project contributions in the Spinnaker organization should be associated with a profile page, perhaps generated by an array. Profile pages display links to contributions by that user and contribution stats - number of PRs/issues/comments, length of time since becoming a contributor, role in the Spinnaker project (can be none or from [list here](https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/blob/master/governance.md#roles)), list of CDF projects contributed to, and more (?). For users with a "claimed" account, this page will also optionally display user-entered strings (Full name, about me, Spinnaker Slack handle, links to Spinnaker content) as well as LinkedIn account link, job title and company name data from LinkedIn, Medium account link, YouTube account link. 
1. Contributor Profile Claim & Edit Page
1. Admin Page or View


Question:
1. What exact information of users should be displayed on the home page
2. We will need a wireframe of the homepage.. Just an idea, we can come up with the rest of the information.

Next Steps:
1. Create a sketch of the views to use as a basline for wireframing
1. Find a designer to help with better wireframes
