## Feature & APIs

Views:
1. Home Page - The idea for this page is to provide a few generalized project stats, and two period-configurable "leaderboards" that show the top (20?) contributors in the period (week/month/year). One list should show all contributors, and the other should filter out "Community Contributors" (all contributors minus those from Netflix, Google, and maybe Armory?) Below these lists, we hope to also add areas to browse recent human (non-bot) Pull Requests and Issues, with links to the relevant GitHub pages and to contributor profiles internally. Should link to devstats. Could have a "featured content" area sourced from user-provided links, automated display highly preferable for an OSS-maintained project.
1. Contribution Profile Page - Each GitHub username with project contributions in the Spinnaker organization should be associated with a profile page, perhaps generated by an array. Profile pages display links to contributions by that user and contribution stats - number of PRs/issues/comments, length of time since becoming a contributor, role in the Spinnaker project (can be none or from [list here](https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/blob/master/governance.md#roles)), list of CDF projects contributed to, and more (?). For users with a "claimed" account, this page will also optionally display a user-added photo, user-entered strings (Full name, about me, Spinnaker Slack handle, links to Spinnaker content) as well as LinkedIn account link, job title and company name data from LinkedIn, Medium account link, YouTube account link.

- Count individual user's merged PRs - https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#list-pull-requests
- Count individual user's Issues - https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/#list-repository-issues
- Count individual user's Issue & PR Comments - https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/comments/#list-issue-comments
- Check role in the Spinnaker projects - scrape membership file at https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/blob/master/membership.yml

_Testing notes_: we are testing these APIs using curl, with guidance from [this article](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/github-rest-api-tutorial/). One issue we have run into is differentiating between usage of "organization" "owner" and "username" as used in these APIs. This query worked to reveal pull requests to the repo in question (clouddriver), but it is still unclear to us how we can filter this for a specific actor/user:

```
curl -X GET -u <username>:<token> https://api.github.com/repos/spinnaker/clouddriver/pulls?state="all" | grep state
```

```
curl -X GET -u <username>:<token> https://api.github.com/repos/ExitoLab/spinnaker_gamification_app/issues
```

```
>curl -X GET -u <username>:<token> https://api.github.com/repos/ExitoLab/spinnaker_gamification_app/issues/1/comments
```

```
curl -X GET -u <username>:<token> https://api.github.com/repos/ExitoLab/spinnaker_gamification_app/stats/contributors
```


Additional APIs that might be helpful:
- Get total number of commits in a repository authored by an individual contributor - https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statistics/#get-all-contributor-commit-activity
- List contributors to a specified repo in order of number of contributions (detail for top 500 results) - https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-repository-contributors
- Check if a user is a repo collaborator - https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/collaborators/#check-if-a-user-is-a-repository-collaborator

Features with no found API match:
- List of CDF projects contributed to. Some detail here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20714593/github-api-repositories-contributed-to
- Length of time since becoming a contributor. This is being monitored in some way here - https://spinnaker.devstats.cd.foundation/d/52/new-contributors-table?orgId=1 so we should dissect how they are doing this using [GHArchive](https://www.gharchive.org/)
